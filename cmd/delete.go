All content from the persona's folder will be destroyed through this command.

Deletion is performed using a Golang implementation of Linux shred command, configured to perform 3
iteration, overriding with zero and final file removal.

Note that shred relies on a very important assumption: that the file system overwrites data in 
place. This may not be the case for your file system, please refer to shred documentation for 
further details.

This command loads the current persona from DEVID_ACTIVE_PERSONA environment variable, and this 
value takes precedence over the --persona flag.
